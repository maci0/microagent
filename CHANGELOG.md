# Changelog

All notable changes to microagent, in the order a consumer meets them. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project follows [SemVer](https://semver.org)
from `0.1.0`: under `0.y` the minor carries features and changes that alter a run's default behavior, the
patch carries fixes, and a patch never changes what an existing invocation does. The version lives in
`build.zig.zon` and nothing else declares it; `microagent --version` prints it, and the release workflow
refuses to publish a tag that does not name it.

Only the latest release is supported. There is no backport window and no LTS line: a fix ships in the next
release, and `microagent update` moves you to it.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- `git` tool: read-only `status`, `diff`, `log`, `show` and `blame` with a fixed subcommand list and a
  400-line cap, so git state no longer has to be assembled by the model through `bash`.
- Reply styles. `caveman` sets how terse the agent's own prose is (`off`, `lite`, `full`, `ultra`, and the
  three `wenyan-*` levels) and `ponytail` sets how lazy the code is (`off`, `lite`, `full`, `ultra`). Both
  are read from `$MICROAGENT_CONFIG`, else `~/.microagent/config.toml`, and both have an env override
  (`MICROAGENT_CAVEMAN`, `MICROAGENT_PONYTAIL`). Neither touches the tools, the request shape or the
  conversation: each appends text to the system prompt. With `caveman = "off"` and `ponytail = "off"` the
  system prompt is byte for byte the one `0.1.1` sent.
- `cached_tokens` on the stdout usage line and in each session-log record: the part of the prompt the
  provider served from its prompt cache, read from `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`,
  `prompt_cache_hit_tokens` or `cache_read_input_tokens`. Both are additive JSON keys, so a reader that
  looks up the counters it already knows is unaffected.

### Changed

- `--max-turns` now defaults to 100 (was 60). A run that relied on stopping at 60 turns now gets the
  longer loop; pass `--max-turns 60` to keep the old ceiling.
- Replies are terse by default: `caveman` is `ultra` and `ponytail` is `full` unless the config or env
  says otherwise. A run that wants the prose back sets `caveman = "off"`.

### Fixed

- A `rev` beginning with `-` in a `git` tool call (`git show -3`) was read as an option instead of a
  revision.
- Tool results and assistant text are JSON-escaped, so a diff containing quotes, backslashes or control
  characters no longer corrupts the request body.
- A streamed tool call whose `index` is past the cap is dropped instead of growing the pending-call list
  to that index, which a hostile or broken provider could turn into a multi-gigabyte allocation.
- `microagent update` compares versions instead of testing string equality, so a build ahead of the
  latest published tag (a branch after a version bump, before the release) reports that there is
  nothing to install rather than downgrading itself to the older release. A tag that is not a dotted
  `major.minor.patch` still installs, so tracking a fork whose tags are not versions keeps working.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- `microagent update` on a glibc build asked for an `x86_64-linux-gnu` asset the release never
  publishes, so the install failed. Linux now asks for the static musl asset, which runs on a glibc host
  as well. macOS asset names are unchanged.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-28

First release.

### Added

- The agent loop: streaming chat completions against any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, with a tool loop and
  a turn ceiling.
- Six tools: `bash`, `read`, `write`, `edit`, `search` (ripgrep) and `ast` (ast-grep structural search
  and rewrite). The `git` tool arrived in 0.2.0.
- A positional prompt, so a gauntlet agent definition of `["microagent", "{prompt}"]` works in any flag
  order.
- `--budget`, `--reasoning-effort`, `--ca-bundle`, and `MICROAGENT_BUDGET_SECONDS`,
  `MICROAGENT_REASONING_EFFORT`, `MICROAGENT_CA_BUNDLE`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`.
- Retries: a 429, any 5xx or a dropped connection is retried twice with 1 s and 2 s of backoff; a
  rejected request fails immediately.
- Old tool output is elided once the conversation grows, so a long run's prompt stays inside the
  provider's window instead of re-sending every earlier result.
- A session log at `~/.microagent/sessions/<unix-ns>.jsonl` (`MICROAGENT_SESSION_DIR` moves it, an
  empty value turns it off), carrying one record per model response so a monitor can read tokens per
  second while the run is going.
- `microagent update`, which replaces the running binary from the latest GitHub release after checking the
  asset against its `.sha256` sidecar.
- A release workflow that publishes `x86_64-linux-musl`, `aarch64-linux-musl`, `x86_64-macos` and
  `aarch64-macos` with a checksum sidecar each, and refuses a tag that does not name the version in
  `build.zig.zon`.
